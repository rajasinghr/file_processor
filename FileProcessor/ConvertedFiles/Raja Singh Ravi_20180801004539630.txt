Dear Professor Barbara: 
 
I am writing to apply for Graduate Assistant position at the University of South Florida.  
I am joining for Business Analytics and Information Systems for the Fall 2018 semester. I 
have a prior work experience of four years in Business Intelligence and Healthcare Service 
Desk Analytics.  
 
During my tenure at HTC Global services and CareTech Solutions, as a Reporting Analyst, I 
am part of designing of complete BI ETL and Reporting Platform where thousands of reports 
are dispatched to several hundreds of customers on a periodic basis. I was involved in the 
data modeling of the transactional database for an online data metrics reporting tool, 
writing several PL/SQL queries, and other services. Knowledgeable in working on SAP 
Business Objects, Crystal Reports and reports distribution tools such as APOS. I worked in 
resource forecasting application, Teleopti and developed an in-house leave management 
application, for creating work schedules for service desk agents. Created interactive metrics 
dashboards using Tableau software by connecting to a data warehouse and by writing 
custom SQL queries. 
 I was a Team Lead for Knowledge Base Document Management System project, 
which was completed using Machine learning Classifiers and Indexing libraries in Python. 
Also as a Data Analyst, I worked on various data management projects using Business 
Intelligence reporting and analytics tools. Performed Data Quality tasks like analysis, profiling, 
De-duplication and cleansing for huge customer data sets. Created many data porting ETL 
jobs to port data between different systems using Talend and Informatica Tools.  
 
I was involved in an entire agile software design and development lifecycle and interact with 
different clients for designing business models and gathering business requirements. As, I 
was always in a position to learn new technologies and tools, more eager to work and learn 
in research and development projects and excited to work on new projects. If I had given 
the opportunity, I will do my very best for the position. I truly thank you for considering my 
application. I am always happy to hear back from you. 
 
Sincerely, 
Raja Singh Ravi
